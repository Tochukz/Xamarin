__By Nilanchala Panigrahy__

## Chapter 1: The Anatomy of an Android App  
__The events of an activity__  
By default, when the orientation of a device is changed from portrait to landscape, Android destroys and recreates existing activities to help ensure that the most appropriate layout is used for the current device orientation. If needed, this behavior can be overridden and activities can be retained.


__Common Layouts__  
Deeply nested layouts can have an impact on the performance and should be avoided if possible.  

__Intents__  
Intents are messages that can be sent to the various types of components in an Android app in order to request some type of action to be performed. Intents may be used to accomplish any of the following:  
* Start an activity with the option of receiving a result
* Start or stop a service
* Notify the component of conditions, such as low battery or time zone change
* Request an action from another app, such as request the map app to display a location or request that the camera app take a picture and save it.

## Chapter 2: The Xamarin.Adroid Architecture  
__Getting started with Xamarin__  
* __Xamarin Test Cloud__: Xamarin Test Cloud makes it possible to test mobile apps written in any language on collection of real devices from around the world. You can write you test script using the Xamarin testing framework and automate your app testing from CI Systems.
